# Install UseMotion
# Install Eagle, then restore from backup, located in Photos directory



# Maybe ReadWise to save highlights from books, articles, etc
# But only if PopClip seems useful. So far, the only thing that seems useful is the copy as Markdown
# The ChatGPT extensions for PopClip doesn't seem all that great.



# AI Tools
# Bolt AI because it's beautiful
# Intellibar because it's a menu bar that you can copy and paste into anything
# Quartzite AI because it manages Prompts
